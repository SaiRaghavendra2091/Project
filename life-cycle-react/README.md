#this react application is to learn about life cycle of react js

there are 3 phases in react life cycle.

1. Mounting
2. Updating
3. Unmounting

Mounting phase - It will be run at very first of the application built on the server. - In this phase it will build by below steps - constructor (if it is class based component) --> render(JSX will evaluate) --> React updates DOM and refs (after render html component will build on the server) --> componentDidMount( finally, this method will get invoke which is used for API calls)

Updating phase - Code that needs to be executed whenever the component has re-rendered.(This state will occur after mounting phase if any operations performed and any change in state, props)

updating phase work flow:- changes in state or props --> re-render the jsx --> updates DOM and refs (after re-render html component changes will appear on the server) --> componentDidUpdate( finally, this method will get code that needs to be executed whenever the component has re-rendered)

Unmounting phase - If there is no further use of any component live on server then it will get unmounted. It has one method of componentWillUnmount(It reset states and form of fields)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
